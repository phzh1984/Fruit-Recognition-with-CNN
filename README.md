# Fruit-Recognition-with-CNN

This repository contains a comprehensive dataset of fruit images for training and evaluating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for fruit recognition. The dataset was carefully curated and collected over a period of six months in a controlled lab environment, simulating real-world scenarios commonly encountered in supermarkets and fruit shops. Our goal was to create a robust dataset that can handle various challenges in fruit recognition, such as lighting variations, shadows, pose changes, and more.

Dataset Variability

We introduced a wide range of variations and challenges into the dataset to ensure its robustness and practical applicability. Some of the conditions and variations considered during data collection include:

Pose Variations: Images were captured from different angles and orientations for various fruit categories.

Variable Number of Elements: Fruits of the same category may have a different number of elements (e.g., slices, pieces).

Illumination Variation: Images were taken under different lighting conditions, including natural light, fluorescent lighting, and more.

Color Variations: Images include different colors of the same fruit category.

Cropping and Partial Occlusion: Some images feature partial occlusion and cropping of fruits, simulating real-world scenarios.

Camera Artifacts: We accounted for camera capturing artifacts that can affect image quality.

Specular Reflection Shading: Specular reflections and shading were included in images.

Shadow Scenarios: Images were captured with varying shadows, including shadows from room light, open windows, closed windows, and curtains.

Natural and Artificial Lighting: The dataset includes images taken with both natural and artificial lighting.

Partial Occlusion with Hand: Some images have partial occlusion due to the presence of hands.

Dataset Quality and Realism

To make the dataset more realistic, images were collected at different times of the day and on different days for the same fruit category. This variability in data reflects real-world conditions and enhances the training and testing of recognition models.
